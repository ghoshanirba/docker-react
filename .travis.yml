#tell travis that we will require service docker, travis will install docker in the running container
services:
  -docker

#before_install will have the series of commands that need to be executed before executing the test suite.
#using Dockerfile.dev file because it has the option to run the test suite NOT Dockerfile which is the production Dockerfile. We want to tell travis to run the the test suite first, hence using Dockerfile.dev  
before_install:
  - docker build -t ghoshanirba/docker-react -f Dockerfile.dev .

#tell travis to run the test suite. script section contains the series of steps that will be required to actually run the test suite. expects return code of zero, else it believes that the test suite has failed. 
script:
  - docker run ghoshanirba/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage
  
#the default behaviour of 'npm run test' is that after it executes once, it waits for the user to tell it what to do next, expects a user input and does not terminate automatically. but here we do not have the option to provide an input to 'npm run test' while executing test suites via travis. so we have to terminate the npm run test, otherwise if not terminated travis will think that the 'npm run test' has never executed and is hanging there forever. we need to add '-- --coverage' to end npm run test.
